# Words
Armin loves words. One day he decided to write all the words with the first letter k of the alphabet,
he does this by first writing the words with the least number of letters,
then in the words with the same number of letters, he writes them together in alphabetical order 
(as you know the number It is unlimited words). For example, for k=2 we have:

a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, aab, aba, ...

He wants you to find the nth letter that is written.

For example, for k=2, the sixth letter corresponds to the fourth word (ab) and the answer is b.
